### Small info

- Always sign out (close the remote workspace) when you finish working â€” do not just close the app.
    - In VS Code: click the Remote/GitHub icon in the lower-left corner and select "Close Remote Workspace" (or "Close Remote Connection").
- Commit and push your changes before closing the workspace.
- Why this matters: leaving the remote workspace open can cause stale state and increase the chance of merge conflicts.
